# Test 3

#  We have a list of three strings defined in the code area...

# Extend the code so your program prints out the following out of that list:

# 0-Document.txt
# 1-Report.txt
# 2-Presentation.txt

# filenames = ['document', 'report', 'presentation']

# for index, file in enumerate(filenames):
#     print(f"{index}-{file}.txt")
# =============================================================================

# Test 4

# We have a list of two IPs in the code area.

# Extend the code so your program:

# 1. Prompts the user to input an index (e.g., 0 or 1).

# 2. Depending on the user input, the program should return either You chose 100.122.133.111 or You chose 100.122.133.111

# Note: In order for the system to mark your exercise as correct, your code should return the exact output (i.e., upper case Y in You chose and no spaces or other characters after the IP.

# For example: Enter the index of the IP you want: 1
# You chose 100.122.133.111 

# Solution

# ips = ['100.122.133.105', '100.122.133.111']


# user_prompt = int(input("input an index 0 or 1: "))
# choice = ips[user_prompt]
# xchoice = "You chose"
# print(f'{xchoice} {choice}')
